"""
In this file I'll be creating a wrapper for Essentia Algorithms. These algorithms are quite
simple to use relative to the models, in which you had to constantly load stuff... The main
difference is that here you're most focused on how you provide the data and how you process
the output from the algorithms.

So in the class `EssentiaAlgo` I'll just be defining a bunch of functions that wrap around the
existing Essentia Algorithms and take care of all the processing. This will make it so that all
that has to be provided is a `Track` and the method takes care of the rest.
